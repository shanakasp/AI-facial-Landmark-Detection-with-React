Attention plz;

this one was the first repo that I created regarding this methodology but I faced several issues,

those are, Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection' etc. To overcome this issue you have to 
install/ run this command 

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection

But this one didn't work on npm-based react projects. Therefore I created another repo from yarn react and through that, I was able to overcome these issues.
